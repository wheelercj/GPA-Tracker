Save your course data and calculate your GPAs including transfer GPAs.

## Usage
* For each course, you can enter which university systems have an accreditation agreement. If a course has no agreement, you can enter `none` when the `accreditor` option pops up.
* Do not enter any courses that do not count towards your GPA.
