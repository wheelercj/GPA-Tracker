# GPA-Tracker
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/wheelercj/GPA-Tracker)](https://replit.com/@wheelercj/GPA-Tracker)

Save your course data and calculate your GPAs (including transfer GPAs) and your transferable units.

## Why?
With this GPA tracker, you don't need to enter your course data multiple times to calculate each of your GPAs. Your GPA if you're at a 2-year college might not be the same as your CSU-transferable GPA, and chances are neither of those are the same as your UC-transferable GPA!

## Usage
For each course, you can enter which GPAs the course counts towards when the "Enter accreditor(s)" option pops up. If a course doesn't count towards any GPA, you can leave the accreditor line blank, or simply not enter the course, or enter `none` (or any message you want) as the accreditor.

If you run the program on Repl.it, you will need to download or copy the `saved_courses.txt` file that the program generates to actually save your course data. Repl.it doesn't save this file between visits.
