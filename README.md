# GPA-Tracker
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/wheelercj/GPA-Tracker)](https://repl.it/github/wheelercj/GPA-Tracker)

Save your course data and calculate your GPAs including transfer GPAs.

## Usage
* For each course, you can enter which colleges give credit or have an accreditation agreement. Enter the colleges as a slash-seperated list, e.g. LAVC/CSU/UC
* If you run the program on Repl.it, you will need to download the `saved_courses.txt` file that it generates to actually save. Repl.it doesn't save this file between uses.
